"""
em_mbc.py — dynamic bass guard for the speaker path.

Sits between the EQ and the peak limiter. The limiter stops the SIGNAL
clipping; this stops the DRIVER being asked for excursion it does not have.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE BAND IT IS
---------------------------------------------
The parameters are not invented. They are what the stock firmware runs on
this exact speaker, read off a device from
`/system/vendor/etc/audio-algorithms/MBCL.cfg` (#229):

    crossovers  115 / 500 / 7500 Hz
    band 1    0-115 Hz     ratio 20:1  threshold -50dB  floor -40dB
    band 2  115-500 Hz     ratio  2:1  threshold -10dB  floor -40dB
    band 3  500-7500 Hz    ratio  2:1  threshold -10dB  floor -40dB
    band 4  7500Hz-Nyq     ratio  2:1  threshold -10dB  floor -40dB

**Band 1 is not compression, it is dynamic bass removal**, and it is the
whole point. 20:1 from a threshold of -50dBFS means essentially nothing below
115Hz survives at a normal listening level, while quiet content keeps its low
end. That is the correct answer for a driver this small, and it is the
opposite of what the symptom suggests: "tin-can" sounds like missing bass, so
the instinct is to boost it — which spends excursion on frequencies the
driver cannot produce, and the resulting cone movement intermodulates
everything above it into mud. Removing that content is what makes the
midrange clean.

**Bands 2-4 are deliberately not implemented.** They are one gentle 2:1 law
at -10dB repeated three times, which is broadband compression for loudness
rather than protection — a taste decision that wants a listening test and a
measured driver response behind it, neither of which exists yet. Implementing
them would also mean a three-crossover tree with allpass compensation on
every branch, for a benefit nobody has heard. One crossover is exact and
provable; see below.

THE CROSSOVER IS LINKWITZ-RILEY, AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS NOT
--------------------------------------------------------------
Two bands split by an LR4 pair (Butterworth 2nd order applied twice). LR4's
defining property is that its lowpass and highpass SUM FLAT — measured across
the spectrum at 4096 points, |LP+HP| deviates by 0.0000dB — so with no
compression active this processor does not colour anything.

The first implementation split subtractively (`rest = x - lowpass`), which is
exactly reconstructing by construction and looks obviously right. It does not
work: at 60Hz the lowpass passes 0.998 of the signal and the residual is
**1.279**, larger than the input, because subtracting a phase-shifted copy is
not the same as removing a band. Bass reduction of 20dB in band 1 produced a
measured 0.4dB at the output. Found by measurement, not by reading it.

    Peak-to-peak deviation of the four allpass-compensated bands' sum, in
    dB — the multi-band equivalent of crossover_flatness_db.

    A naive recursive split (keep halving the high branch, as
    crossover_flatness_db's single-crossover case does) does NOT sum flat
    once nested: measured 1.59dB of ripple near the crossovers, because an
    LR4 split's sum is flat only in MAGNITUDE — its PHASE rotates with
    frequency (measured up to 111 degrees near a crossover) — so summing
    bands that went through a DIFFERENT NUMBER of filter stages adds
    mismatched phases, not just flat gain.

    The fix is standard multi-way crossover design: give every band the
    SAME total number of stages by running the earlier ones through an
    ALLPASS version (that crossover's own LP+HP, summed and used only for
    its phase) of every later crossover they did not actually split on —
    see RadarMultiband. That makes the whole network end to end a cascade
    of allpass filters, each contributing |H|=1, so the product is exactly
    1: measured 4.6e-11dB, at the floor of float64 rather than merely small.

    Radar's real 4-band MBCL, in full, configured from the Echo's own
    MBCL.cfg (spec, an em_radar_tuning.Mbcl).

    Three crossovers split the signal into four bands; each band runs its
    own compressor then its own peak limiter, both with their own input
    trim (comp_inVol/lim_inVol); the four are summed. The combined
    full-band limiter (em_limiter.build_limiter) is NOT
    part of this class — it is MBCL's own "Full-band limiter" entry and
    stays exactly where it already runs, downstream of this, in
    em_player.py/em_eq.py.

    EXACT FLATNESS, THROUGH ALLPASS COMPENSATION
    ----------------------------------------------
    See four_band_flatness_db's docstring for why a naive recursive split
    does not sum flat and what fixes it. In this network: band 1 (which
    only ever sees the fc1 split) is additionally run through an allpass
    of fc2 and then of fc3; band 2 (fc1 and fc2) is additionally run
    through an allpass of fc3; bands 3 and 4 already carry all three
    splits' worth of filtering and need no compensation. Every
    compensation filter below is an INDEPENDENT instance of the same
    coefficients as the real split it stands in for — same transfer
    function, separate state, because it is filtering a different signal.
