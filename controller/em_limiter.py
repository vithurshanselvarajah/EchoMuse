"""
em_limiter.py — look-ahead peak limiter for the speaker path.

Sits after the EQ and before int16 conversion, so the whole chain stays in
float and nothing is quantised twice.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`em_eq` used to end in `np.clip`, which is a hard clipper. The dashboard
offers eight ±12dB faders plus a presence boost, so any combination that
pushed past full scale was square-waved sample by sample, silently. Measured
on a speech-like signal at −1dBFS with a modest bass boost: 4.74% of samples
clipped (#231). That is the same failure as the DAC clipping fixed in #162,
one stage earlier and in our own software.

A gain trim is the obvious fix and the wrong one: attenuating by the chain's
peak response makes a +12dB bass boost 12dB quieter overall, which the user
experiences as "the EQ made it quiet". A limiter keeps the loudness and
controls only the peaks — which is why the stock firmware carries a
multiband compressor-limiter rather than a trim.

DESIGN
------
Three stages, all vectorised — this runs on every audio chunk, so a
per-sample Python loop is not available to us.

1. **Look-ahead.** The gain is computed from a running MAXIMUM of |x| over
   the next `lookahead` samples, so it has already come down by the time the
   peak arrives. That is what makes the attack inaudible without a separate
   attack filter, and it is why the limiter is not a clipper with extra
   steps.

2. **Slew-limited release, in dB.** Gain may fall instantly but may only
   RISE at `release_db_per_s`. Written as a recursion that would be
   sequential:

       g[n] = min(target[n], g[n-1] + slew)

   which is a running minimum in a sheared coordinate system, so it is exact
   and vectorised rather than approximated:

       e[k] = target_db[k] − slew·k
       g_db[n] = slew·n + min(e[0..n])            (np.minimum.accumulate)

   The shear is rebased per chunk so `slew·n` cannot grow without bound
   across a long stream.

3. **A final clip that must never engage.** Kept as a backstop, and it is
   counted: if `clipped` is ever non-zero while the limiter is LIMITING,
   the limiter has a bug, and a silent backstop is how the original
   problem survived. While the limiter is BYPASSED the same backstop
   legitimately catches a boosted EQ's output — that goes to
   `clipped_bypassed`, so the two readings cannot be confused (#275):
   identical counts in both states would send someone hunting a bug in a
   limiter that is behaving correctly.

STATE
-----
Carried across chunks: the tail of the previous chunk (for the look-ahead
window) and the last gain. Without it, every chunk boundary would restart
the release and the music path would pump audibly at each one — the same
reason `em_eq.StreamingEQ` carries its biquad states.

#   by a ramp from that ratio back toward 1, so the reduction leads the peak

# - a 20-sample hold (fs*0.001*0.416667) before release starts
# - release LINEAR in gain, back to unity over N samples, where N comes
#   from the configured release clamped to 180..400ms. MBCL.cfg's 80 and 20ms
#   releases therefore run at 180ms; the -3dB/20ms full-band limiter is a
