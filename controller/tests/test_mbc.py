Tests for the dynamic bass guard.

The tests that matter are the ones that catch the two ways this goes wrong
silently: colouring audio it was not asked to touch, and appearing to work
while removing nothing. The first implementation did the second — a
subtractive crossover measured 20dB of reduction inside the band and produced
0.4dB at the output, because subtracting a phase-shifted copy is not removing
a band. Every frequency-domain assertion here exists because of that.
